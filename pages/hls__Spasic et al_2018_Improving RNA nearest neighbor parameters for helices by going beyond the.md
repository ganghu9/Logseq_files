- The partition function description of nucleic acids, however, predicts a prominent nontwo-state behavior, with fraying of terminal base pairs and opening of AU pairs, a behavior that is also observed in NMR experiments (31–34). This contradicts the assumption under which the nearest neighbors are derived, i.e. that molecules are either completely folded or unfolded. This creates a paradox where a method is using parameters to predict a behavior that is impossible under the assumptions with which the parameters were derived.

- Table 1 lists all the duplexes and melts used in the fit. All duplexes had lengths from 5 to 10 base pairs and 11 duplexes were self-complementary. All optical melting experiments were performed in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl,10 or 20 mM sodium cacodylate and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.

- Remarkably, the final square root of the sum of squared residuals in all runs were the same to within 0.001, and the values of fitted free energies of Watson–Crick, terminal AU and initiation parameters at37◦C were within 0.01 kcal/mol (lower than the error reported for the 2-state-derived parameters) in all 100 fits.

- To facilitate comparison of the two fitting methods, a nearest neighbor parameter set was also derived using the same procedure as in the previous work (16), but using only the 34 duplexes available for the partition functionbased fits. As shown in Table 2, the fit performed with the subset of duplexes results in small deviations from the literature parameters.

- The square root of the sum of squared residuals of the fraction of bases paired, the quantity that was used to measure the quality of fit, decreased from 15.605 when using the literature two-state parameters (16) to 9.594 with the partition function-fitted parameters, an improvement of 38.5%.

- Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S4 illustrate that the newly fitted parameters describe melting behavior more accurately than the prior two-state-derived parameters. In addition, all parameter sets predict terminal base pairs have lower base pairing probabilities than pairs interior to the helix, which is a result of the expected end fraying of the helix.

- Furthermore, two-state models predict that no loops should form during the folding/unfolding process. Therefore, we set the enthalpy and entropy values for all loop neighbor parameters for the two-state models to 10.0 kcal/mol and −1.0 e.u., respectively, producing an approximately 10 kcal/mol free energy change in the range of temperatures used. This high value prevents loop formation in these two models that do not allow loop formation.

- of the literature two-state models for 20 of 34 duplexes and for averages over duplexes or over melts. Unlike the RMSD tests in Figure 2, literature two-state parameters outperform the two-state fit of 34 duplexes. The pairwise t-tests indicate that the improvement of the partition-function-fit parameters is statistically significant compared to the two-state fit to 34 duplexes, but not compared to the literature parameters.
