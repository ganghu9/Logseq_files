	- ###### All the elements that can affect the prediction of RNA secondary structure -- helics, loops and bulges
	- ##### thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions refers to information about the stability and energetics of the interactions between different regions or motifs within the three-dimensional structure of RNA molecules. This data helps in understanding how different parts of the RNA molecule interact and contribute to its overall folding. Identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites involve determining the specific locations within the RNA molecule where metal ions, such as magnesium or zinc ions, bind. Metal ions play a crucial role in stabilizing the tertiary structure of RNA and influencing its folding process. Characterizing these metal-ion binding sites provides insights into the structural and functional aspects of RNA molecules and their interactions with metal ions. Both thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions and the identification/characterization of metal-ion binding sites are important for unraveling the mechanisms and dynamics of RNA folding, as well as understanding the functional properties of RNA molecules.

	- ###### You need all of this thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interaction, identification and characterization of metal ion binding size. Besides, you also need to apply some mechanical forces to individual RNA molecules and measuring their resulting extensions or deformations.
	- ##### Force versus extension measurements involve applying mechanical forces to individual RNA molecules and measuring their resulting extensions or deformations. This experimental technique allows researchers to study the mechanical properties and behavior of RNA molecules under various conditions. By manipulating and stretching RNA molecules, researchers can observe how they respond to external forces. The applied force can be measured using specialized techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or optical tweezers, which can exert controlled forces on the molecule while monitoring its extension. These measurements provide valuable information about the mechanical stability, flexibility, and elasticity of RNA molecules. They can help determine the folding pathways, mechanical unfolding or folding forces, and the role of specific structural elements or interactions in the overall mechanical behavior of RNA. By combining force versus extension measurements with other data, such as thermodynamic information and computational algorithms, researchers can gain insights into the folding kinetics, stability, and functional properties of RNA molecules. This information is crucial for understanding the structure-function relationship of RNA and its role in various biological processes.
