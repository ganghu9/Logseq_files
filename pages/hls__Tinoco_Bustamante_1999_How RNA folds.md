- In RNA the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2á.

- Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure.

- This may mean that we need to know one part of the structure at atomic resolution, another part in terms of Watson-Crick base-pairs formed, and the rest of the molecule only approximately.

- If base paired regions in an RNA molecule are conserved over many species, it is assumed that they are important in function.

- If only a single sequence is available for the RNA, secondary structure calculations can predict the basepaired regions. In viral RNAs the most stable calculated helices correlate with regions that are known to have important biological roles, such as internal ribosome entry sites
